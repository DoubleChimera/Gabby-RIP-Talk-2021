I finally put together a couple of ideas for how we can compare tdt samples to HaloTag samples. One figure could be comparing the average length of trajectories in halotag and tdt samples and represent that in frame #. Also another figure could be the average number of trajectories per unit area that meet our qc of 200 frame minimum. I have data put together for Keratinocyte tdt and halotag on top of Neural stem cell tdt and halotag. We excitingly have our 3rd cell type for halotag data which is blood endothelial cells :). I am working on processing it now but it may not be done in time. Let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything I can do! 

Look on Rivendell: PathakLab/Lab/HaloTag
Data located here: Files are Analyzed_Tracks_tdt_mkera, Analyzed_Tracks_tdt_mNSPC, Analyzed_Tracks_htKera, Analyzed_Tracks_htNSC
